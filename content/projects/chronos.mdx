## Overview

Chronos is a library and cli designed for bulk calendar management. It allows you to mass-edit, orchestrate, and parse calendar events with ease.

## Motivation

Managing calendar events manually can be tedious, especially when dealing with recurring events, bulk modifications, or importing/exporting between different calendar systems. Chronos was built to solve these problems by providing a powerful CLI interface for calendar operations.

## Heads up!

I have had little time to actually work on this page. Check out the project repo for real time updates.
