# Portfolio Pagei

Hey there. This is my corporate style portfolio page.

## This page has no soul

I don't really stand for the writing and style of this page. SEO tends to
prioritize generic text with a lack of depth.

## Why do you want good SEO on a portfolio page?

I raise this question because I guess portfolio pages are meant to be passed
by word of mouth or links on your work?

Once, a person actually found my webpage on search results and we worked together.
They were one of the nicest people I've interacted with. Every person counts, so
if I can go from one to two people or even more, I am down for that.

Enter at your own risk.

Made with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS.

I am not a web developer, so I was assisted in design and writing by Claude
Code: it can write effective SEO slop, and it can tank all the HTML I don't
have time to write. I have other projects that I care about. I inspect and
correct all the code it generates to ensure that the page isn't flawed or a
security risk (which would be a whole new level of incompetence for a
portfolio page).
